# Scombinatorics

These are some aberrant notes on combinatorics.

>   We approach set systems and bipartite graphs with model theory in the back of our mind.
>
>   Notation is borrowed from logic, without any clear purpose, and is used consistently throughout the notes - even when it obscures theorems and bloats proofs.

They may be aberrant also for other reasons that I am not aware of.
